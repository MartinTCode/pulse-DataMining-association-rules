\label{chap:business-understanding}

The purpose of this assignment is to find interesting patterns in a bakery's sales data. 
We want to understand which items customers tend to buy together. 
This information can be useful in several ways, for example\:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Marketing and promotions:} 
the bakery could offer bundle deals on items that are often bought together.

\item \textbf{(Digital) Store layout:} 
placing related items close to each other might increase sales.

\item \textbf{Inventory planning:} 
knowing which items are connected can help with stock management.
\end{enumerate}

Our data mining goal is to use association rule mining to identify these kinds of relationships. The rules we find should show how often certain items appear together and whether those combinations are strong enough to be useful for business decisions.
