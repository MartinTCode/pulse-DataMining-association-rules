\label{chap:business-understanding}

The purpose of this assignment is to find interesting patterns in a bakery's sales data. 
We want to understand which items customers tend to buy together. 
This information can be useful in several ways, for example\:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Marketing and promotions:} 
the bakery could offer bundle deals on items that are often bought together.

\item \textbf{(Digital) Store layout:} 
placing related items close to each other might increase sales.

\item \textbf{Inventory planning:} 
knowing which items are connected can help with stock management.
\end{enumerate}

Our data mining goal is to apply association rule mining to identify these relationships. 
The resulting rules should indicate how often certain items appear together 
and whether such combinations are strong enough to support business decisions.
