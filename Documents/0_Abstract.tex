This report presents the process and results of a market basket analysis conducted on a bakery transaction dataset 
using association rule mining. The dataset contained over 20,000 records and 94 unique items, which made it 
well-suited for discovering patterns in customer purchases. The analysis was carried out in both RapidMiner and 
Knime, following the CRISP-DM framework. Preprocessing grouped transactions into baskets, and association rules 
were generated by adjusting support and confidence thresholds to achieve a meaningful balance.

The most consistent finding across both tools was that customers who buy Toast are very likely to also buy Coffee, 
with a confidence of 70.4\%. Other associations, such as Cake with Hot Chocolate or Salad leading to Coffee, also 
emerged. While some rules reflected expected purchasing behaviour, others offered less intuitive insights into 
customer habits. The evaluation confirmed that the rules were statistically valid, interpretable, and useful for 
supporting business decisions related to marketing, store layout, and inventory planning.
