The results of the association analysis can be deployed in several ways to support the bakeryÂ´s decision making.
Deployment is the final phase of the data mining process as described in the CRISP-DM framework ~\cite{crispdm}.
For example, if the analysis shows that customers often buy coffee together with a pastry or toast, 
the bakery could place these products closer to each other in the store to encourage the customer to buy the items. 
They could also offer discounts when buying bundles of items to increase sales. 

The results could also support inventory management. By identifying which products are frequently purchased together, 
the bakery can plan their stock and reduce the risk of shortages ~\cite[Ch.~9]{courseLitt}.  

These insights can help the bakery understand customer habits and increase customer satisfaction by making 
it easier to find the products they are likely to want together ~\cite[Ch.~6]{BigData}.
