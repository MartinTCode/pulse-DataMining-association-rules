\label{chap:data-preprocessing}
In this assignment, no preprocessing was performed on the dataset prior to importing it into RapidMiner  ~\cite{RapidMiner} 
and Knime ~\cite{Knime}. Instead, preprocessing was carried out within the workflow of each program. This is consistent with the 
CRISP-DM process model, where preprocessing is typically applied before modeling ~\cite[Ch.~3]{courseLitt}.

In RapidMiner ~\cite{RapidMiner} after importing the data, we selected the relevant attributes. 
Since only TransactionNo and Items were needed for the analysis, DayTime, Daypart and DayType were excluded. 
The aggregate operator was then applied to concatenate Items. After this step, another attribute selection 
was performed to exclude TransactionNo and only keep the concatenated Items. 

In Knime ~\cite{Knime} after importing the data, a column filter operator was used to exclude DayTime, Daypart and DayType 
so that only TransactionNo and Items are included. The GroupBy operator was then applied, using the TransactionNo 
as the group column and aggregating the Items with the Set function.
