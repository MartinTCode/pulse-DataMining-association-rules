In this assignment we have done a market basket analysis using association rules mining as technique.
We have learned with the help of tools like Altair RapidMiner and Knime how to find frequent itemsets and association rules.
in a structured dataset like the Bakery transaction dataset. We have also learned the importance of choosing the
right parameters for the algorithms to get useful results and how to interpret them. We find these techniques useful
for market basket analysis and recommend them for similar tasks in the future. This kind of analysis can help businesses
to understand customer behavior and improve their marketing strategies.
