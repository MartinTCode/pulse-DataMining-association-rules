\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data availability:} The Google Maps API offers accessible and structured data on restaurants,
    including ratings, number of reviews, price level and geographical location. This availability of data
    is essential for conducting a thorough analysis.
    \item \textbf{Relevance and interest:} Dining is both culturally and economically significant in Stockholm.
    This makes the restaurant sector a relevant and interesting area for analysis. Patterns in ratings,
    locations and pricing may provide insights into consumer behavior and market trends.
    \item \textbf{Potential business insights:} By analyzing correlations in the dataset, restaurants and 
    stakeholders could learn more about factors that can influence customer satisfaction and popularity.
    For example, correlations between proce levels and ratings might provide insight into percieved 
    value for money.

>>>>How2UseTables (& how to escape special chars):
For our analysis, we selected the following attributes and configured their data types
as shown in Table~\ref{tab:attribute_config}:

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|p{5cm}|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Interpreted As} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \hline
    rating & numeric & integer & Star rating from 1-5 \\
    \hline
    reviews & numeric & real & Count of customer reviews \\
    \hline
    derived\_price\_level & numeric & real & Our consolidated price indicator \\
    \hline
    distance\_km & numeric & real & Distance from city center, calculated from coordinates \\
    \hline

The implementation was carried out in both Altair RapidMiner and Knime. In RapidMiner, this was done
using the \textit{Correlation Matrix} operator,

>>>> How2WriteMathSnippets:

For entries with missing price\_level but available price ranges, we derived 
comparable levels using SEK thresholds ($\leq150 = 1$, $\leq300 = 2$, 
$\leq600 = 3$, $>600 = 4$).
